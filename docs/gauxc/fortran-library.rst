GauXC in Fortran
================

This guide demonstrates how to use the GauXC library from Fortran to evaluate exchange-correlation functionals, including the Skala neural network functional.
By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Set up a CMake project with GauXC as a dependency
* Initialize the GauXC runtime environment
* Read molecule, basis set, and density matrix from an HDF5 input file
* Configure the integration grid, load balancer, and XC integrator
* Evaluate the exchange-correlation energy and potential

Setting up CMake
----------------

GauXC integrates most conveniently via CMake.
We will set up a minimal CMake project for a command-line driver that uses GauXC.
In addition to GauXC, we will include other dependencies as needed.

The directory structure for the project will be

.. code-block:: text

   ├── CMakeLists.txt
   ├── app
   │   └── main.F90
   └── cmake
       ├── skala-flap.cmake
       ├── skala-dep-versions.cmake
       └── skala-gauxc.cmake

First, we create the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` to define our project, include dependencies, and declare the executable.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/CMakeLists.txt
   :language: cmake
   :caption: CMakeLists.txt

To manage dependencies cleanly, we create a separate file in the ``cmake/`` subdirectory that stores URLs and checksums for all external packages.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/cmake/skala-dep-versions.cmake
   :language: cmake
   :caption: cmake/skala-dep-versions.cmake

Each dependency gets its own CMake include file.
First, we define how to include GauXC, our main dependency.
CMake will first attempt to discover an installed GauXC via its config file; if that fails, it will download and build GauXC from source.
The options defined in the main CMake file are passed through to GauXC to ensure the library provides the requested features.
After GauXC is available, we verify that our requirements are satisfied—this is especially important for the Skala implementation, which requires the ``GAUXC_HAS_ONEDFT`` feature flag.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/cmake/skala-gauxc.cmake
   :language: cmake
   :caption: cmake/skala-gauxc.cmake

For the command-line interface, we use the FLAP library (Fortran command Line Arguments Parser).

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/cmake/skala-flap.cmake
   :language: cmake
   :caption: cmake/skala-flap.cmake

This completes the CMake setup required for our command-line driver.

Module imports
--------------

The main driver program imports the relevant GauXC modules.
We also use GauXC's HDF5 I/O module and the FLAP module for command-line parsing.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 1-31

Each GauXC component has a corresponding Fortran module:

`gauxc_status`
  Handles GauXC status codes and error messages.

`gauxc_molecule`
  Manages molecular data structures (atomic numbers and Cartesian coordinates).

`gauxc_basisset`
  Manages basis set data (shell definitions, exponents, contraction coefficients).

`gauxc_molgrid`
  Sets up and manages the numerical integration grid.

`gauxc_runtime_environment`
  Interfaces with MPI and device (GPU) runtime environments.

`gauxc_load_balancer`
  Distributes grid points across available compute resources.

`gauxc_molecular_weights`
  Computes Becke-style partitioning weights for the molecular grid.

`gauxc_xc_functional`
  Handles exchange-correlation functional definitions.

`gauxc_integrator`
  Performs the numerical integration of the exchange-correlation energy and potential.

`gauxc_matrix`
  Manages matrix data structures (density matrices, potentials).

Next, we declare variables for the GauXC-specific types:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 33-45

We also declare variables for input parameters and intermediate values:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 47-55

When compiled with MPI support, we initialize MPI at program startup.
The ``gauxc/gauxc_config.f`` header provides the ``GAUXC_HAS_MPI`` preprocessor macro for guarding MPI-specific calls.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 57-59

Similarly, at the end of the program we finalize MPI:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 277-279

Command line interface
----------------------

This guide uses an HDF5 input file to provide molecular data.
(GauXC also supports constructing these objects programmatically, which is more convenient when embedding GauXC in a library.)
We also expose parameters for configuring the integration grid and parallelization strategy.
The main command-line arguments are:

``input_file``
  Path to an HDF5 file containing the molecule, basis set, and density matrix.

``model``
  The model checkpoint to evaluate (e.g., ``PBE`` for a traditional functional or a path to a Skala checkpoint).

``grid_spec``
  The grid size specification, which controls the number of angular and radial integration points.

``rad_quad_spec``
  The radial quadrature scheme, which determines the spacing of radial integration points.

``prune_spec``
  The pruning scheme, which controls how atomic grids are combined into a molecular grid.

We use the ``command_line_interface`` type from the FLAP library to define the CLI.
First, we initialize variables with their default values:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 61-66

Next, we initialize the CLI and define the available arguments.
A named ``block`` statement provides convenient error handling:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 68-94,134-142

.. note::

   The molecular grid settings (``grid_spec``, ``rad_quad_spec``, ``prune_spec``) are documented in detail in the :ref:`gauxc_molecular_grid_settings` reference.

After defining the CLI, we parse it within the ``input`` block and retrieve the values:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 96-133

Before adding further implementation, let's build and test the project.
Configure and compile with:

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake -B build -G Ninja -S .
   cmake --build build

Once built, run the driver with ``--help`` to verify it works:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./build/Skala --help

You should see the help page generated by FLAP:

.. code-block:: text

   usage: ./build/Skala  value --model value [--grid value] [--radial-quadrature value] [--pruning-scheme value] [--lb-exec-space value] [--int-exec-space value] [--batch-size value] [--help] [--markdown] [--version]

       Print this help message
      --markdown, -md
       Save this help message in a Markdown file
      --version, -v
       Print version

The CLI is now fully functional and allows flexible configuration from the command line.

Initializing GauXC
------------------

We begin by initializing the GauXC runtime environment.
All GauXC-related calls are placed inside a named ``block`` for streamlined error handling:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 148-159

At the end of the block, we check the status and clean up the runtime environment:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 255-261

The runtime environment provides the MPI world rank and size (for both MPI and non-MPI builds).
We print the configuration obtained from the command line:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90
   :lines: 161-170

From here on, we use ``world_rank`` to ensure only rank 0 produces output.


Molecule data
-------------

We use GauXC's built-in HDF5 reader to load the molecule data.

.. note::

   GauXC stores the information about the atomic numbers and their coordinates as an array of structs, defined in C++ as

   .. code-block:: c++

      struct GauXC::Atom {
        int64_t Z; ///< Atomic number
        double x;  ///< X coordinate (bohr)
        double y;  ///< Y coordinate (bohr)
        double z;  ///< Z coordinate (bohr)
      };
      class GauXC::Molecule : public std::vector<GauXC::Atom> {
        ...
      };

   The HDF5 wrapper maps this struct representation directly to the HDF5 dataset.

The ``gauxc_read_hdf5_record`` subroutine loads the molecule data:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (read molecule)
   :lines: 172-177

For proper memory management, we free the molecule object at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free molecule)
   :lines: 262


Basis set data
--------------

We load the basis set using the same HDF5 approach as for the molecule.

.. note::

   The basis set is represented as an array of shell objects, each containing primitive exponents,
   contraction coefficients, angular momentum, and shell center:

   .. code-block:: c++

      template <typename F>
      class alignas(256) GauXC::Shell {
        std::array<F, 32> alpha; ///< exponents of primitives
        std::array<F, 32> coeff; ///< contraction coefficients
        std::array<double, 3> O; ///< origin of the shell
        int32_t nprim; ///< number of primitives
        int32_t l; ///< angular moment of the shell
        int32_t pure; ///< pure=1: spherical Gaussians; pure=0: cartesian Gaussians
      };

      template <typename F>
      struct GauXC::BasisSet : public std::vector<GauXC::Shell<F>> {
        ...
      };

   Again, this allows the object's representation to map directly to an HDF5 dataset.

We read the basis set using ``gauxc_read_hdf5_record``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (read basisset)
   :lines: 179-184

We free the basis set at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free basisset)
   :lines: 263

Integration grid
----------------

The integration grid defines the spatial points for evaluating the exchange-correlation functional.
Three parameters control grid construction:

- **Grid size**: Density of angular and radial points (e.g., ``fine``, ``ultrafine``)
- **Radial quadrature**: Spacing scheme for radial points (e.g., ``muraknowles``)
- **Pruning scheme**: How atomic grids combine into the molecular grid (e.g., ``robust``)

GauXC uses enumerators for these settings. We define helper functions to convert CLI strings:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (enumerator conversion functions)
   :lines: 281,294-337

We create the molecular grid from our input parameters.
The batch size controls how many grid points are processed together; larger values (up to ~10000)
improve performance, though the default is 512:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (grid setup)
   :lines: 186-193

We free the grid at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free grid)
   :lines: 264

Exchange-correlation integrator
-------------------------------

The load balancer distributes XC functional evaluation across available resources (host or device).
A helper function converts the execution-space CLI string to an enumerator:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (execution space enumerator)
   :lines: 281-292

The load balancer manages access to the molecule, basis, and grid data for all subsequent GauXC operations.
We create it from our input parameters:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (load balancer setup)
   :lines: 193-210

Finally, we create the XC integrator using a factory pattern.
A settings object specifies the model checkpoint to evaluate:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (integrator setup)
   :lines: 212-218

We free the integrator and associated objects at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free integrator)
   :lines: 265-271

Density matrix
--------------

The density matrix is the final input for GauXC.
We read it from the HDF5 file:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (read density matrix)
   :lines: 220-226

We free the density matrix at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free density matrix)
   :lines: 272-273

Exchange-correlation evaluation
-------------------------------

With all inputs ready, we perform the XC evaluation:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (exchange-correlation evaluation)
   :lines: 233-237

.. tip::

   To measure evaluation time, define a helper function:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
      :language: fortran
      :caption: app/main.F90 (time helper function)
      :lines: 339-344

   Use it to wrap the evaluation and print elapsed time:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
      :language: fortran
      :caption: app/main.F90 (timed exchange-correlation evaluation)
      :lines: 228-243

We output the computed XC energy:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (exchange-correlation output)
   :lines: 245-253

We free the allocated XC potential matrices at program end:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/fortran/gauxc_integration/app/main.F90
   :language: fortran
   :caption: app/main.F90 (free exchange-correlation potential)
   :lines: 274-275

Rebuild the project:

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake --build build

Run the driver from the build directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./build/Skala He_def2-svp.h5 --model PBE

.. note::

   Create the ``He_def2-svp.h5`` input file using the ``skala`` package:

   .. literalinclude:: scripts/export-h5.py
      :language: python

The output shows results for the PBE functional:

.. code-block:: text

   Configuration
   -> Input file        : He_def2-svp.h5
   -> Model             : PBE
   -> Grid              : fine
   -> Radial quadrature : muraknowles
   -> Pruning scheme    : robust

   Results
   Exc          = -1.0540318683E+00 Eh
   |VXC(a+b)|_F =  1.4559829661E+00
   |VXC(a-b)|_F =  0.0000000000E+00
   Runtime XC   =  2.5566819200E-01

Download checkpoint from HuggingFace
------------------------------------

To evaluate Skala, download the model checkpoint from HuggingFace using the ``hf`` CLI
from the ``huggingface_hub`` package:

.. code-block:: shell

   hf download microsoft/skala skala-1.0.fun --local-dir .
   ./build/Skala He_def2-svp.h5 --model ./skala-1.0.fun

The output shows results for the Skala functional:

.. code-block:: text

   Configuration
   -> Input file        : He_def2-svp.h5
   -> Model             : ./skala-1.0.fun
   -> Grid              : fine
   -> Radial quadrature : muraknowles
   -> Pruning scheme    : robust

   Results
   Exc          = -1.0712560874E+00 Eh
   |VXC(a+b)|_F =  1.5002997546E+00
   |VXC(a-b)|_F =  0.0000000000E+00
